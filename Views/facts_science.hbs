      <h3>Unveiling the Wonders of STEM</h3>
      <p>Discover the Power of Facts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</p>
        <p>
            Facts are objective and verifiable pieces of information that are based on empirical evidence and can be proven to be true.
            In the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field, facts form the foundation upon which scientific theories, technological advancements, and engineering designs are built.
            Facts help scientists and researchers establish a common understanding and shared knowledge, enabling them to make informed decisions and draw accurate conclusions.
            In STEM disciplines, facts are obtained through rigorous experimentation, observation, data analysis, and peer-reviewed research, ensuring the reliability and validity of the information.
            By relying on facts, STEM professionals can develop innovative solutions, advance knowledge, and contribute to the progress and improvement of society through evidence-based practices and discoveries.

                <li>DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all living organisms.</li>
                <li>Genes are segments of DNA that encode specific traits or characteristics.</li>
                <li>Genetic mutations can lead to variations in traits and can be the basis for evolution.</li>
                <li>Humans share about 99.9% of their DNA with each other.</li>
                <li>Gregor Mendel is considered the father of modern genetics for his pioneering work with pea plants.</li>
